# UVM_GCD_Testbench
This repository involves modifying an existing SystemVerilog testbench for a GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) module by introducing a modular architecture. The enhanced testbench includes components such as a generator, driver, monitor, scoreboard, interface, clocking block, and synchronization using mailboxes and events.
